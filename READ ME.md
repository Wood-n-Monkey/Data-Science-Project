About the project:
=================

In this project I will try to see i using data from different version updates of the game Dota 2 I could predict the heroes played in
the biggest Dota 2 tournament, The International.


Summary of the project and final results:
=========================================

In the project I collected the basic data about changes of heroes from version to version (patch to patch). Analysed the data and 
tried to predict the chosen heroes in TI last match. 

Because the problem turned out to be more complex then i thought, it needed to be altered and scaled down. 
Also the approach that was taken may not be the correct one, or more advanced technique needed to be used.
Still there were developed usefull scrapping functions that with additional moddification and changes could extract even
more data, and more specific and wide range of data.

Also it shows that the game holds to its comlexity, in game mechanics and strategic components. So maybe the prediction of
which hero is better to choose no matter what dont exist. Which on its own a good thing as it gives interesting matches to watch
and range of possibilities for player making tactical plays.
